# Road to Vostok — Community Mod Loader

A community-built mod loader for **Road to Vostok** (Godot 4). Adds a launcher UI before the game starts, letting you enable/disable mods, set load order priority, check for updates, and preview compatibility issues before they cause problems in-game.

---

## Requirements

- Road to Vostok(PC, Steam)
- Mods packaged as `.zip`, `.vmz`, or `.pck` files

---

## Installation

1. Copy `override.cfg` into the game installation folder:
   ```
   C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Road to Vostok\
   ```

2. Copy `modloader.gd` into the game's data folder:
   ```
   C:\Users\<your username>\AppData\Roaming\Road to Vostok\
   ```

3. Create a `mods` folder inside the game installation folder if it doesn't exist:
   ```
   C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Road to Vostok\mods\
   ```

4. Place your `.vmz` or `.zip` mod files inside the `mods` folder.

5. Launch the game normally. The mod loader UI will appear before the main menu.

---

## Installing Mods

Drop `.vmz` or `.zip` mod files into the `mods` folder. The mod loader finds them automatically on next launch.

`.pck` files are also supported (can be enabled/disabled and prioritized in the UI, but no mod.txt parsing, autoloads, or update checking).

---

## The Launcher UI

When you start the game, the mod loader window opens with tabs:

### Mods
Lists all detected mods. Use the checkbox to enable or disable each one. The **Priority** spinbox controls load order — higher value loads later and wins any file conflicts. The **Load Order** panel on the right shows the final order in real time.

### Updates
If your mods include ModWorkshop update info in their `mod.txt`, click **Check for Updates** to fetch the latest versions and download updates directly.

### Compatibility
*(Developer mode only)* Click **Run Analysis** to scan your enabled mods without mounting anything. Reports script conflicts, broken override chains, overhaul mod warnings, and Database.gd replacement issues before they affect your game.

### Settings
Toggle developer mode on/off. Developer mode enables:
- **Compatibility tab** — static analysis of override conflicts
- **Compile check** — loads each override script before launch to catch parse errors
- **Override audit** — warns when `overrideScript()` targets have zero live nodes in the scene tree
- **Conflict report** — full log saved to `modloader_conflicts.txt` after each launch
- **Debug logging** — verbose `[Debug]` lines covering load order, override timing, and mount state
- **Loose folder loading** — unzipped mod folders in the mods directory are treated as mods

Click **Launch Game** (or close the window) when you are ready to play.

## mod.txt Reference

Mods can include a `mod.txt` at the root of their archive to register autoloads, set metadata, and enable update checking:

```ini
[mod]
name=My Mod
id=my_mod
version=1.0.0
priority=0

[autoload]
MyModMain=res://Scripts/MyModMain.gd

[updates]
modworkshop=12345
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `name` | Display name shown in the UI |
| `id` | Unique identifier — duplicates are skipped |
| `version` | Semver string used for update comparison |
| `priority` | Load order weight. Higher = loads later = wins conflicts. Default 0. |
| `[autoload]` | `Name=res://path/to/script.gd` — instantiated as a Node after all mods mount |
| `[updates] modworkshop` | ModWorkshop mod ID for update checking |

Mods without `mod.txt` are still mounted as resource packs — their files override vanilla resources, but no autoloads run.

---

## Supported Archive Formats

| Format | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| `.vmz` | Road to Vostok's native format (renamed zip) |
| `.zip` | Standard zip — must use forward-slash paths internally |
| `.pck` | Godot PCK — mount only, no mod.txt or autoloads |

---

## Understanding the Conflict Report

After each launch (with developer mode enabled), a full conflict log is written to:

```
%APPDATA%\Road to Vostok\modloader_conflicts.txt
```

### What the messages mean

- **CONFLICT: {path}** — Two mods shipped the same file. The last-loaded mod wins. Adjust priorities if the wrong one is winning.
- **Script Conflict: {file}** — Two mods both call `take_over_path()` on the same script. Only the last-loaded version is active.
- **Chain Broken: {file}** — Mods using `overrideScript()` can stack via `extends + super()`. A mod in the chain is missing `super()` calls, so earlier mods' logic gets dropped.
- **Database.gd Replaced** — A mod replaced `Database.gd`. Scene overrides from other mods may not take effect due to `preload()` caching.
- **Likely Incompatible / Overlap** — Two mods modify many of the same files. The more overlap, the less likely they'll work together.
- **Method Overlap** — Two mods override the same function on the same script. Even with `super()`, their changes may interfere.
- **Bad Archive: {mod}** — The zip has backslash file paths (common with Windows repacking). Re-pack using 7-Zip.
- **class_name Crash: {name}** — Two mods override a script with `class_name`. Godot bug [#83542](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/83542) causes a fatal engine crash. Disable all but one.
- **Missing Script: {file}** — A mod extends a script that no longer exists. The game may have been updated.
- **Uses base(): {mod}** — A mod calls `base()` which is a Godot 3 pattern. Should be `super()` in Godot 4.
- **Stale preload(): {file}** — A mod uses `preload()` on a file that another mod replaces. Use `load()` instead.

---

## For Mod Authors

- **Conflicts are load-order dependent.** Test with other mods installed and check the conflict report.
- **If you replace Database.gd**, every `preload()` path in your version must exist or the game will break.
- **Use `super()` in lifecycle methods.** Skipping it silently breaks any other mod that overrides the same class.
- **Avoid `take_over_path()` on commonly-overridden scripts** when possible. The `extends + super()` pattern composes across mods; flat `take_over_path()` doesn't.
- **`UpdateTooltip()` does not affect world items.** World-item tooltip text comes from `HUD._physics_process` reading `gameData.tooltip`.
- **Windows zip repacking** — use 7-Zip or a tool that writes forward-slash entry paths. .NET `ZipFile.CreateFromDirectory()` writes backslash paths by default, which Godot can't resolve.

---

## Uninstalling

Delete `override.cfg` from the Steam installation folder and `modloader.gd` from the AppData folder. The `mods` folder and its contents can be removed separately.

Settings are stored in `%APPDATA%\Road to Vostok\mod_config.cfg` and can be deleted safely.
